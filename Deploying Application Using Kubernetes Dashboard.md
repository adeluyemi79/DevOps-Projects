# **Deploy the Application Using the Kubernetes Dashboard**


## **Course-end Project 1**
## Description
## Objectives
## To deploy a multi-tier PHP and MySQL application using Kubernetes with specific configurations for user roles, storage, service verification, namespace restrictions, quota limits, and data management.
## Problem Statement and Motivation
## **Real-Time Scenario:**

## Karen is a DevOps engineer at a tech startup. Her team has developed a new application using PHP and MySQL. Now, it is her task to deploy that application.
## The company plans to utilize Kubernetes for its robust container orchestration capabilities.
## Karen must create a Kubernetes dashboard with specific configurations, user roles, storage, service verification, and data management.
## Industry Relevance :

## The following tools utilized in this project are widely applied in the industry:
## 1. kubeadm: A utility that offers kubeadm init and kubeadm join as efficient ways to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters. It focuses on bootstrapping rather than machine provisioning.
## 2. kubectl: A command-line interface for Kubernetes that allows execution of commands against Kubernetes clusters. It can be used for deploying applications, managing cluster resources, and viewing logs.
## 3. kubelet: An essential node agent present on every node in a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that the containers described in the provided PodSpecs are running and healthy.
## 4. Docker: Docker is a tool designed to facilitate developers in building, sharing, and running applications in containers. It takes care of the setup, allowing developers to concentrate on the code.

# **Tasks**

## **The following tasks outline the application using Kubernetes:**

## 1. Getting started with pods, services, and deployments
## 2. Creating and verifying the service
## 3. Creating a token and working on a dashboard
## 4. Configure the NFS-server for MySQL and WordPress deployment
## 5. Setting up the NFS client side
## 6. Creating and verifying the PV
## 7. Creating a secret for MySQL deployments secret data
## 8. Creating a configmapfor WordPress deployment to store non-sensitive information
